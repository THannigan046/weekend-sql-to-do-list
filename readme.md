# Weekend sql to do list


_Duration: weekend sprint

For one of our weekend challenges at prime digital academy, we were asked to create a full stack to do list app using jquery, node, sql and bootstrap. One of the biggest challenges of this project was learning how to write SQL queries in a router. However, like anything else, I sat down and got it done. 


### Prerequisites

Create a database called ‘tasks’ (or whatever you want to call it) 
Run the database.sql file
Npm install 
Npm start


## Usage


input a task in the text box, then click add to add it to the list! If your task appears red, that means the task is incomplete. Click complete to mark it as done and turn it green, and click delete to delete it from the database.  



## Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [jQuery] (https://jquery.com/)
- [PostgreSQL]  (https://www.postgresql.org/)
